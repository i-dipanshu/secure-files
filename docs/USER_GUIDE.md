# ZKP File Sharing - User Guide

## üöÄ Welcome to ZKP File Sharing

ZKP File Sharing is a secure, passwordless authentication system that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs for login. Instead of traditional passwords, you use cryptographic keys that prove your identity without revealing any secrets.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### **‚úÖ Do These Things**
- **Backup your keys** immediately after registration
- **Store backups securely** (password manager, encrypted storage)
- **Use HTTPS** - never enter keys on unsecured sites
- **Keep keys private** - never share with anyone
- **Log out** when using shared computers
- **Generate keys on trusted devices** only

### **‚ùå Never Do These Things**
- **Share private keys** via email, messaging, or verbally
- **Store keys in plain text** files on your computer
- **Use the same keys** for multiple services
- **Screenshot or photograph** your private keys
- **Generate keys on public/shared computers**

### **üîê Storage Recommendations**
1. **Password Managers**: Store backup files in your password manager
2. **Encrypted USB Drive**: Physical backup on encrypted storage
3. **Secure Cloud Storage**: Encrypted cloud storage with strong passwords
4. **Paper Backup**: Write down key and store in a safe place (for emergency)

## üéì Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs

### **What Makes This Different**
- **No passwords**: Your identity is proven mathematically
- **Nothing revealed**: Your private key never leaves your device
- **Cryptographically secure**: Uses the same security as Bitcoin
- **Future-proof**: Quantum-resistant cryptographic methods

### **How It Works (Simple Explanation)**
1. **You have a secret** (private key) that only you know
2. **You create a proof** that you know the secret without revealing it
3. **The server verifies** the proof against your public key
4. **If valid**, you're authenticated and logged in

### **Benefits for You**
- **Enhanced security**: No passwords to steal or guess
- **Privacy protection**: Your secrets stay with you
- **Convenience**: No password resets or complexity requirements
- **Modern technology**: Using cutting-edge cryptographic research

## üìã Quick Reference

### **Key Formats**
- **Private Key**: `0x` + 64 hexadecimal characters (66 characters total)
- **Public Key**: `04` + 128 hexadecimal characters (130 characters total)

### **Session Duration**
- **Default**: 30 minutes from login
- **Extension**: Use "Refresh Session" button
- **Auto-logout**: Occurs when session expires

### **File Types**
- **Key Backup**: `.json` files containing your key pair
- **Import Format**: JSON with `privateKey`, `publicKey`, and metadata

### **Browser Storage**
- **Location**: Browser localStorage (local to your device)
