# SecureFiles - User Guide

## üöÄ Welcome to SecureFiles

SecureFiles is a modern, secure file sharing platform that uses Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) authentication for passwordless login. Instead of traditional passwords, you use cryptographic keys that prove your identity without revealing any secrets.
